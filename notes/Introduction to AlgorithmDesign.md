lgorithm design is the skill of turning a problem into a **correct, efficient, step-by-step solution**.
In practice, it’s mostly about:

1. choosing the right **data structure**
    
2. choosing the right **pattern**
    
3. proving correctness (at least informally)
    
4. analyzing time and memory
