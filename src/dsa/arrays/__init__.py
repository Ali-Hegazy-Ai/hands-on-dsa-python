"""Array operations module.

This module contains implementations of array-based data structures and
operations including dynamic arrays, prefix sums, and two-pointer techniques.

TODO:
    - Implement DynamicArray with full resize logic
    - Implement prefix sum algorithms
    - Implement two-pointer techniques (sorting, merging, etc.)
    - Add comprehensive error handling
    - Add performance optimizations
